||| This mainloop mainloop stack reads line-separated JSON records
||| from stdin.
|||
||| Use this with an external program to drive the UI for testing,
||| debugging, or other exotic uses. See `input-shim.py` and `run.sh`
||| for an example.
|||
||| The other advantage to this MainLoop is that it only depends on base.

||| Decodes the given event type from Stdin.
|||
||| The tag identifies the event type, whose contents are then decoded
||| from JSON. The resulting Idris value is then passed to a decoder
||| state machine.

||| A MainLoop which receive events as a stream of JSON records on STDIN.
|||
||| An external process is responsible for collecting events and
||| passing them to the application. See `input-shim.py` for an example.
|||
||| This MainLoop instance is useful for testing and debugging.
|||
||| XXX: this code is a bit more general than necessary at the
||| moment. It looks as if it supports multiple distinct event types,
||| however, it doesn't.
