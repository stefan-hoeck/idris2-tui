%default total


||| A heterogenous stack of Components.
|||
||| @top  The top type of the stack
||| @root The root type of the stack.
|||
||| Note: This was a tricky data-strcuture to get right. One key
||| detail is that the top of the stack is a function which returns a
||| component. The other key detail is the `top` index, which allows
||| the type checker to recognize the empty stack at the type level.
|||
||| I've tried other variatons on this idea, and this seems to be the
||| best.
public export
data Stack : Type -> (top : Type) -> (root : Type) -> Type where
  Nil  : Stack e root root
  ||| @merge Function to merge top of the stack with the element beneath.
  (::) : (merge : Maybe top -> Component e a) -> Stack e a root -> Stack e top root

||| A context for modal interaction.
|||
||| @rootT Type of the value yielded by context.
|||
||| A component manages a stack of components, routing events to the
||| topmost component.
|||
||| When the top component responds with `Yield`, it is removed from
||| the stack, and the yielded value merged into the next stack
||| element, if any exists. If the stack is empty, then the `Modal`
||| itself yields the root value.
|||
||| Note: this type is needed to hide the `top` index on the stack,
||| otherwise we could just use `Stack` itself as a component.
public export
record Modal eventT rootT where
  constructor M
  component : Component eventT topT
  stack : Stack eventT topT rootT

-- we can use `(.topT)` instead, which reads better anyway. `topT`
-- just ends up shadowing useful type arguments. I wish for some
-- better control over record elaboration in future versions of Idris.
--
-- the other way to handle this is to disable unbound implicits, but
-- this then requires explicit quantification, which is overkill here.
%hide Modal.topT

||| Remove the top component from the modal stack.
|||
||| @self   The current modal context.
||| @result The value to merge or yield.

||| Push a component into the Modal context, with the merge function.

||| You shouldn't need to call this. It is used by `runComponent` in
||| the `MainLoop` to wrap the root component.
export

||| This is the top-level event handler for a modal context.

||| This view nests modals visually using `inset`.
