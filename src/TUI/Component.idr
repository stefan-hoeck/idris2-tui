%default total

||| The result of handling an event within a component.
|||
||| This type extends `Extends.Result` with the `Push` case, which
||| signals that control should pass to a child component. Because
||| `Push` takes a component as a parameter, it must be defined in
||| this module.
|||
||| Note: this type is forward-declared, because mutual blocks do not
||| work with records, owing to a bug in Idris.
public export data Response : Type -> Type -> Type -> Type

||| A function which handles an event in a component.
|||
||| There are two variants: `Component.Handler` and `User.Handler`.
|||
||| Note: this type alias is forward-declared, because mutual blocks
||| do not workw ith records, owing to a bug in Idris.
public export
0 AbstractHandler
  :  (stateT       : Type)
  -> (valueT       : Type)
  -> (globalEventT : Type)
  -> (localEventT  : Type)
  -> Type

||| This type is the top-level event handler within a component.
|||
||| This is distinct from `Event.Handler` in that it returns a
||| `Response` rather than a `Result`. Because it is top-level, the
||| local and and global event types must agree.
public export
0 Handler
  :  (stateT : Type)
  -> (valueT : Type)
  -> (eventT : Type)
  -> Type
Handler stateT valueT eventT = AbstractHandler stateT valueT eventT eventT

||| A reusable user-interface element.
|||
||| Component is closely tied to `Stack` and `Modal`.

-- Hide this projection function. we use (.state) instead. This
-- suppresses warnings about `state` being shadowed in the definitions
-- below.

||| A component wraps a View, so a component is also a view.
export
View (Component _ _) where
  size self = size @{self.vimpl} self.state
  paint state window self = paint @{self.vimpl} state window self.state


||| These definitions make writing event handlers a bit nicer.
namespace ComponentDSL

  ||| A generic response: update with the given IO action.
  export
  continue : stateT -> Response _ stateT _
  continue state = Continue $ state

  ||| A generic response: update with the given value.
  export
  update : stateT -> Response _ stateT _
  update state = Continue $ state

  ||| A generic response: yield given value to the parent, or exit.
  export
  yield : valueT -> Response _ _ valueT
  yield value = Yield value

  ||| A generic response: exit.
  export
  exit : Response _ _ _
  exit = Exit

  ||| A generic response: yield or exit, depending on argument.
  export
  exitWith : Maybe valueT -> Response _ _ valueT
  exitWith Nothing  = exit
  exitWith (Just v) = yield v

  ||| A generic response: do nothing.
  export
  ignore : {auto self : stateT} -> Response _ stateT _
  ignore = update self

  ||| A generic response: yield if value is `Just`, ignore if nothing
  export
  exitIf : {auto self : stateT} -> Maybe valueT -> Response _ stateT valueT
  exitIf Nothing  = ignore
  exitIf (Just v) = yield v

  ||| A generic response: pass control to the given child component.
  |||
  ||| When the component yields or exits, the result is folded into the
  ||| current component via `merge`.
  export
  push
    :  {0 eventT : Type}
    -> (top   : Component eventT topT)
    -> (merge : Maybe topT -> stateT)
    -> Response eventT stateT valueT
  push top merge = Push top merge

  ||| A getter function which always returns Nothing
  |||
  ||| This is for components which cannot yield a partial value, or
  ||| which are still in development.
  export
  unavailable : stateT -> Maybe valueT
  unavailable _ = Nothing

||| Update a component in response to an event.
|||
||| This wraps the stored handler, which operates on `State`, turning
||| it into the component-level handler which is needed by client
||| code.
export
handle : Component.Handler (Component eventT valueT) valueT eventT
handle event self = case self.handler event self.state of
  Continue state => update $ {state := state} self
  Yield result   => yield result

  Push top merge => push top $ updateInner merge
where
  updateInner : (Maybe a -> self.State) -> Maybe a -> Component eventT valueT
  updateInner merge result = {state := merge result} self

||| Construct a component.
|||
||| This takes a concrete type, view implementation, event handler,
||| and value accessor, returning an opaque value that reveals only
||| its value type and event type.
|||
||| Component is used extensively in this library to provided
||| re-usable building blocks for UIs.
export

  }

  ||| Compose multiple `Single.Handler`s into a `Component.Handler`.
  export

    :  {0 events : List Type}
    -> {0 stateT, valueT : Type}
    -> All (Single.Handler {events} stateT valueT) events
    -> Component.Handler stateT valueT (HSum events)
  union handlers event state = go handlers event state
    where
      -- subtle stuff here: globalEventT must always be `HSum events`,
      -- while `localEventT` must be free to vary, as we recurse.
      go
        :  All (Single.Handler {events} stateT valueT) a
        -> AbstractHandler stateT valueT (HSum events) (HSum a)
      go (h :: _ ) (Here  e) s = h e s
      go (_ :: hs) (There e) s = go hs e s

  ||| A dummy handler, for use with `union`.
  export
  unhandled : (0 eventT : Type) -> Single.Handler stateT valueT eventT
  unhandled _ event self = ignore

  ||| Lift a handler for a single event into a handler for a union.
  export
  only
    :  {0 events : List Type}
    -> Has eventT events
    => Single.Handler {events} stateT valueT eventT

  only wrapped event state = case the (Maybe eventT) $ project' event of
    Nothing => ignore
    Just key => wrapped key state


||| Take a `Component _ a` to a `Component _ b` via `f`.
|||
||| This is useful for specializing library components to
||| application-specific types.
|||
||| The function `f` applies only to the yield value, leaving the
||| internal state and interactive behavior unchanged.
|||
||| Example: Take a generic numeric component and produce a
||| length. Here, `(.mm`) is a function `Double -> Length`.
|||
|||    inputMM : Length -> Component Length
|||    inputMM length = (.mm) <$> numeric (length.convertTo MilliMeters)
export
Functor (Component eventT) where
  map f wrapped = component @{wrapped.vimpl} wrapped.state handle get
    where
      get : wrapped.State -> Maybe b
      get self = f <$> wrapped.get self

      handle : Component.Handler wrapped.State b eventT
      handle event state = case wrapped.handler event state of
        Continue state => Continue state
        Yield result   => yield $ f result
        Exit           => exit
        Push top merge => push top merge

||| This is like above `map`, but takes a partial function.
|||
||| This is useful when you want to do further processing or
||| validation on the yield value.
|||
||| Note: if the wrapped component yields, but `f` returns Nothing,
||| the response is equivalent to `ignore`, rather than `exit`. The
||| assumption is that the component has failed validation, and so the
||| component should remain in place.
|||
||| XXX: does this correspond to a prelude interface?
export
mapMaybe : (a -> Maybe b) -> Component e a -> Component e b
mapMaybe f wrapped = component @{wrapped.vimpl} wrapped.state handle get
  where
    get : wrapped.State -> Maybe b

    handle : Component.Handler wrapped.State b e
    handle event state = case wrapped.handler event state of
      Continue state => Continue state
      Yield result   => exitIf $ f result
      Exit           => exit
      Push top merge => push top merge

||| Cute alias for `mapMaybe' above.

(<$?>) : (a -> Maybe b) -> Component e a -> Component e b
(<$?>) f c = mapMaybe f c
